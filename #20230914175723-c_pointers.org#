#+title: C Pointers
A Pointer Variable is a variable whose value is the address of some memory location.
__ =Syntax= _
#+begin_src C
  int *ptr; //or
  int*    ptr;//is valid too.
#+end_src
But, the second is not a good technique and here is why...
#+begin_src C
  int*  a,b,c;
#+end_src
/gives an impression that all =a=, =b=, =c= are pointers but they aren't. Only =a= is pointer, the rest are Integers./
#+begin_src C
  int *a,*b,*c; //is the inteded declaration.
#+end_src
* Initialization
Declarations can also be used to initialize as shown...
#+begin_src C
  char *message = "Namaste World!";
#+end_src
Actually Means...
#+begin_src C
  char *message;
  char message = "Namaste World!";
#+end_src
** Explaination
lets start with an example.
#+begin_src C
int x;
int *p_x=&x;
#+end_src
The above statements:
+ Declares variable x with 4 bits of storage say with =addresses 1,2,3,4=.
+ Now, note that =&x=1= only, not =2, 3 or 4=. Second line declares a pointer =p_x= to the variable =x=.
  


* Constants and Pointers
** Pointer to a constant integer
Here, Pointer may change but the integer stored in the addres of the pointed variable wont change.
#+begin_src C
  int const *pci;   //  pci --> Pointer to a Constant Integer
#+end_src
*** Properties
The declaration of pci as a pointer to a constant integer means:
• pci can be assigned to point to different constant integers
• pci can be assigned to point to different nonconstant integers
• pci can be dereferenced for reading purposes
• pci cannot be dereferenced to change what it points to
** Constant Pointer to an Integer
The Value of the variable may change but the pointer won't.
#+begin_src C
  int * const cpi; // cpi --> Constant Pointer to an Integer
#+end_src
*** Properties
With this declaration:
• cpi must be initialized to a nonconstant variable
• cpi cannot be modified
• The data pointed to by cpi can be modified
** Constant Pointer to a Constant Integer
#+begin_src C
  int const * const cpci; // cpci --> Constant Pointer to a Constant Integer
#+end_src
* Pointer Addition
Pointer addition makes changes in the address stored by the pointer.

For example, form above =explanation 1= if we perform =p_x+1= the address will become =5= or =p_x+2= will change address to =9=.
