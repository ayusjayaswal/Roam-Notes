#+title: Nodal Analysis
* About
Nodal Voltage Analysis uses the “Nodal” equations of Kirchhoff’s first law to find the voltage potentials around the circuit.

At each node point write down Kirchhoff’s first law equation, that is: /“the currents entering a node are exactly equal in value to the currents leaving the node”/ then express each current in terms of the voltage across the branch.

So by adding together all these nodal voltages the net result will be equal to zero. Then, if there are “n” nodes in the circuit there will be “n-1” independent nodal equations

* Example
lets look at an example circuit...

/Usually,we assume Vd = 0/ and it is called =REFERENCE NODE=.
From Nodal analysis we write.

As Va = 10v and Vc = 20v , Vb can be easily found by:

* Tutorial Summary

The basic procedure for solving Nodal Analysis equations is as follows:

1) Select a node as the reference node. Assign voltages V1, V2… Vn-1 to the remaining nodes. The voltages are referenced with respect to the reference node.
2) Apply KCL to each of the non reference nodes.
3) Use Ohm’s law to express the branch currents in terms of node voltages.Node Always assumes that current flows from a higher potential to a lower potential in resistor. Hence, current is expressed as follows [[./img/node_analysis.gif]]
4) After the application of Ohm’s Law get the ‘n-1’ node equations in terms of node voltages and resistances.
5) Solve ‘n-1’ node equations for the values of node voltages and get the required node Voltages as result.
