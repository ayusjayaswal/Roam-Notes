#+TITLE: Algebra: Extended Euclidean Algorithm

** Bézout's Theorem

Bézout's Theorem states that for any two integers \(a\) and \(b\), there exist integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that:

\[
a \cdot x + b \cdot y = \gcd(a, b)
\]

where \(\gcd(a, b)\) is the greatest common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\). This theorem provides a way to express the GCD of two integers as a linear combination of those integers.

** Extended Euclidean Algorithm

The Extended Euclidean Algorithm not only computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers \(a\) and \(b\) but also finds integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that:

\[
a \cdot x + b \cdot y = \gcd(a, b)
\]

It is an extension of the Euclidean Algorithm and can be used to find such coefficients \(x\) and \(y\). The algorithm proceeds as follows:

1. **Compute the GCD**: Use the Euclidean algorithm to find \(\gcd(a, b)\).
2. **Find Coefficients**: Use back-substitution to express the GCD as a linear combination of \(a\) and \(b\).
