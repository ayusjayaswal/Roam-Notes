* Proposition
=A proposition is a declarative sentence (that is, a sentence that declares a fact) that is either true or false, but not both.=

+ A tautology is a statement that is always true.
+ A contradiction is a statement that is always false.
+ A Contigency is neither tautology nor contradiction.
  
** A PREDICATE Is a function or relation that takes one or more arguments and returns a truth value (True or False).

** QUANTIFIERS Specify the extent to which a predicate is true over a range of elements. The two main types of quantifiers are universal and existential.
*** Types of Quantifiers
+ Universal Quantifier ( ∀ )
+ Existential Quantifier ( ∃ )
  
** The area of logic that deals with propositions is called the propositional calculus or propo- sitional logic. It was first developed systematically by the Greek philosopher Aristotle more than 2300 years ago.

*** Truth table of p -> q
|---+---+------|
| p | q | q->q |
|---+---+------|
| T | T | T    |
| T | F | F    |
| F | T | T    |
| F | F | T    |
|---+---+------|

CONVERSE  q → p

CONTRAPOSITIVE  ¬q →¬p

INVERSE  ¬p →¬q

** Let p and q be propositions. The biconditional statement p ↔ q is the proposition “p if and only if q.”
The biconditional statement p ↔ q is true when p and q have the same truth values, and is false otherwise.
Biconditional statements are also called bi-implications.

*** TRUTH TABLE p ↔ q

* PRECEDANCE of operators follows order: ¬, ∧, ∨,→, and ↔

* ARGUMENT FORM
An argument in propositional logic is a sequence of propositions.All but the final proposition in the argument are called premises and the final proposition is called the conclusion.

An argument is valid if the truth of all its premises implies that the conclusion is true.

An argument form in propositional logic is a sequence of compound propositions involv- ing propositional variables.

An argument form is valid no matter which particular proposi- tions are substituted for the propositional variables in its premises, the conclusion is true if the premises are all true.
