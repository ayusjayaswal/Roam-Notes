#+title: STL: Pair
std::pair is a class template that provides a way to store two heterogeneous objects as a single unit.
* Features...
+ The first element is referenced as ‘first’ and the second element as ‘second’ and the order is fixed (first, second).
  
+ Pair can be assigned, copied, and compared. The array of objects allocated in a map or hash_map is of type ‘pair’ by default in which all the ‘first’ elements are unique keys associated with their ‘second’ value objects.
  
+ To access the elements, we use variable name followed by dot operator followed by the keyword first or second.
