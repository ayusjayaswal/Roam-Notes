#+title: Horner's Method
Horner's method (or Horner's scheme) is an algorithm for polynomial evaluation.

=This allows the evaluation of a polynomial of degree n with only n multiplications and n additions. This is optimal, since there are polynomials of degree n that cannot be evaluated with fewer arithmetic operations=
