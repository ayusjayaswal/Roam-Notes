#+title: Java Language

* About
Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.

** How Java Works...
*** Source
Create a source document. Use an established protocol (in this case, the Java language).
*** Compiler
Run your document through a source code compiler.
The compiler checks for errors and won’t let you compile until it’s satisfied that everything will run correctly.
Here Compiler is =Javac= available in /java-11-openjdk/.
*** Output
The compiler creates a new document, coded into Java =bytecode=.  
Any device capable of running Java will be able to interpret/translate this file into something it can run.
/The compiled bytecode is platform-independent./
*** Virtual Machines
The virtual machine reads and runs the bytecode.
* Code Structure in Java

[[./img/java_code_structure.png]]

** Source FIle
A source code file (with the .java extension) holds one class definition.
The class represents a piece of your program, although a very tiny application might need just a single class.
** Class
A class has one or more methods. In the Dog class, the bark method will hold instructions for how the Dog should bark.
** Method
Within the curly braces of a method, write your instructions for how that method should be performed.
Your methods must be declared inside a class (in other words, within the curly braces of the class).
