#+title: Bitwise Applications
* ODD or EVEN
If a number _n_ is odd then /n&1 == 1/
* Check if a number is a power of two
if a number _n_ is a power of two /x&(x-1) == 0/
=Note: Does not work for n = 0= 
* Working with kth bit of a number _x_
- check if kth bit is set /x&(1<<k)/  --> =True if kth bit is set=
- Toggle the kth bit /x^(1<<k)/
- Set the kth bit /x|(1<<k)/
- Unset the kth bit /x&!(1<<k)/
* Multiplication and Division by pow(2,k)
- Multiply with pow(2,k) /n<<k/
- Divide with pow(2,k) /n>>k/
* Swapping without third variable
x=x^y
y=x^y
x=x^y
* Toggle between two values (if x is a make it b if x is b make it a)
x = a ^ b ^ x
/is same as/
  if(x==a)x=b;
  else x=a;
* Binary Addition
a+b = a^b + 2(a&b)
a+b = a|b + (a&b)
