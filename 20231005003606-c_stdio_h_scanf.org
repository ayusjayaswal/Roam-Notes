#+title: C stdio.h scanf()
Reads data from a variety of sources, interprets it according to format and stores the results into given locations.
1) reads the data from =stdin=
2) reads the data from file stream
3) reads the data from /null-terminated character string buffer/. Reaching the end of the string is equivalent to reaching the end-of-file condition for fscanf
