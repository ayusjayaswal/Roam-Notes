#+title: The Brick Factory Problem
* Introduction


[[./img/the_brick_factory_problem.png]]

Tur√°n's brick factory problem asks for the minimum number of crossings in a drawing of a complete bipartite graph.

Mathematically, this problem can be formalized as asking for a graph drawing of a complete bipartite graph, whose vertices represent kilns and storage sites, and whose edges represent the tracks from each kiln to each storage site.

The graph should be drawn in the plane with each vertex as a point, each edge as a curve connecting its two endpoints, and no vertex placed on an edge that it is not incident to. A crossing is counted whenever two edges that are disjoint in the graph have a nonempty intersection in the plane.

The question is then, what is the minimum number of crossings in such a drawing?

*** Solution

Formula tells the minimum number of crossings.
