=Deterministic Algorithm:= An algorithm that, given a particular input, always produces the same output and follows the same sequence of steps.

=Non-deterministic Algorithm:= An algorithm that may exhibit different behaviours on different runs, even with the same input, due to non-deterministic choices made during execution.

=P (Polynomial Time):= The class of decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic algorithm in polynomial time.

=NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial Time):= The class of decision problems that can be solved by a non-deterministic algorithm in polynomial time.

=NP-hard:= The class of problems that are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP. Every problem in NP can be reduced to an NP-hard problem.

NP-complete: The class of problems that are both in NP and NP-hard. They are the hardest problems in NP.
