#+title: DSD: SOP(DNF),POS(CNF),Minterm,Maxterm

* SOP (Sum of Products) or DNF (Disjunctive Normal Form):
/Definition: A Boolean expression in which ANDed terms (products) are ORed together./
Form: 
𝐹 = (𝐴∧𝐵)∨(¬𝐴∧𝐶)

Derived From: Rows in the truth table where the output is 1 (True).

Example: 
𝐹 = 𝐴′𝐵′𝐶 + 𝐴𝐵′𝐶′ + 𝐴𝐵𝐶

Representation: Sum of MINTERMS.
** Minterms:
Definition: A product term where each variable appears exactly once, either in true or complemented form.
Represents: Each row where the function outputs 1 (True).
Ex: SOP is a sum of MINTERMS.

** Maxterms:
Definition: A sum term where each variable appears exactly once, either in true or complemented form.
Represents: Each row where the function outputs 0 (False).
Ex: POS is a product of MAXTERMS.

* **Minterms are complements of maxterms for the same input combination.**

* Relationship Between SOP & POS:
SOP (DNF): Uses minterms, true for when the output is 1.
POS (CNF): Uses maxterms, true for when the output is 0.

* Canonical Form:

Definition: A Boolean expression where each term includes every variable in the system either in true or complemented form.

* Non-Canonical Form:

Definition: A Boolean expression where not all terms include all variables.

The expression is simplified, typically through Boolean algebra, without explicitly listing every variable in each term.

* Conversion Between Canonical and Non-Canonical Forms:

Non-Canonical to Canonical (SOP):
Step 1: Identify the missing variables in each term.
Step 2: Expand each term by applying the distributive property.
Step 3: Add terms where the missing variables are in both true and complemented form.

Example:
Non-Canonical: 𝐴 + 𝐵𝐶
Expand to include all variables:
1. 𝐴 = 𝐴(𝐵+𝐵′)(𝐶+𝐶′)
2. 𝐵𝐶 = 𝐵𝐶(𝐴+𝐴′)
Canonical SOP: 
𝐴𝐵𝐶+𝐴𝐵'𝐶'+𝐴'𝐵𝐶
